# RatePage
MediaWiki extension that enables users to rate pages on a wiki and set up contests.
More information and documentation: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:RatePage

This version deals with a need where in my setup my wiki is behind NAT. This means I lose the IP address of the client and anonymous users could not vote as we do not allow most user an account.

The 'fix' was to allocate an anonymous users an ID via a cookie (dont event point out the issues, as I am aware!)

The maintainer of the original project is [Ostrzyciel](https://gitlab.com/Ostrzyciel).
